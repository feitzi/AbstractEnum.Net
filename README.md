# AbstractEnum.Net
With AbstractEnum.net you can easily use Java like enums with own enum properties. 
This package is based on the code of [HeadSpringLabs/Enumeration](https://github.com/HeadspringLabs/Enumeration).

You are welcome to contribute to this .Net Standard Library with a new pull request or create a new issue.

## Usage of AbstratEnum.Net
Here is a self-explaining code snipped which illustrates the definition of weekdays with a property Â´isWeekday'

#### Declare a new 'Enum'-Typ
````c#
 public class Weekday : AbstractEnum<Weekday> {
        public static readonly Weekday Monday    = new Weekday("Monday",true);
        public static readonly Weekday Tuesday   = new Weekday("Tuesday", true);
        public static readonly Weekday Wednesday = new Weekday("Wednesday",true);
        public static readonly Weekday Thursday  = new Weekday("Thursday",true);
        public static readonly Weekday Friday    = new Weekday("Friday",true);
        public static readonly Weekday Saturday  = new Weekday("Saturday",false);
        public static readonly Weekday Sunday    = new Weekday("Sunday", false);

        public bool IsWeekday { get;  }

        private Weekday(string value, bool isWeekday) : base(value) {
            IsWeekday = isWeekday;
        }
    }
````

#### Usage of Typ Weekday
````c#
 Weekday sunday = Weekday.Sunday;
 var isWeekday = sunday.IsWeekday; // false
 var allDaysDuringTheWeek = Weekday.GetAll().Where(x => x.IsWeekday); //  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday   

 if (Weekday.Monday == sunday) { // its false
     Console.WriteLine("I wish this line will be printed every monday :D");
 }
